Description: This pacakge includes classical algorithms such as local search,
    iterated local search, simulated anneling or genetic algorithms. It also
    includes problems such as TSP, QAP, Graph Coloring, etc. The main goal of the
    package is to used to teach metaheuristics at the University of the Basque Country.
