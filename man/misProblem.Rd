\title{Maximum independent set}
\usage{
misProblem(graph, penalization = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{Graph where we have to find the maximum independent set (MIS)}
}
\value{
A list of functions to be used to solve a MIS problem. This includes the functions \code{evaluate}, for the evaluation of a solution, \code{valid}, to check whetehr a solution is valid or not, \code{correct}, to correct a non-valid solution and \code{plot} to graphically show the solution; all the functions have a single argument,  \code{solution}. The solutions passed to these functions has to be a logical vector indicating with \code{TRUE} which nodes are in the independent set.
}
\description{
This function generates an evaluation, validity and correction functions associated  with a classical maximum independet set problem
}
\details{
The evaluation function includes another parameter, \code{penalization}, which can be used to penalize non-valid solutions. The penalization terms is the number of nodes that are connected in the solution, and it is weighted with the factor passed in the \code{penalization} parameter By default its value is 0.
