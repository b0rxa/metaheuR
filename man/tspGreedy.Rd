\title{Constructive greedy algorithm for the TSP problem}
\usage{
tspGreedy(cmatrix, cl.size = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{cmatrix}{Cost matrix associated to the TSP instance}

\item{cl.size}{Size of candidate list considered at each step. By default it is 1, thus implementing a sheer greedy algorithm. If this value is greater than 1, then random solutions are created considering at each step the best options, as in GRASP algorithms}
}
\value{
A permutation containing a solution for the problem
}
\description{
This function implements a simple constructive greedy algorithm for the TSP problem
}
\details{
The algorithm builds the solution iteratively, selecting, at each step, the closest city to the one added in the previous step
}
\examples{
n <- 10
cost.matrix <- matrix(runif(n^2), ncol=n)
tspGreedy(cost.matrix, 2)
